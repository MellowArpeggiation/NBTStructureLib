* `.schematic` file support!
    * Developers can now specify and register any file format they please using the new `StructureProviderRegistry`
    * The correct serialization method will be chosen based on the file extension given, no override is currently available
    * By default, `.nbt` serialization will be used
    * It is recommended to not use `.schematic` for structures you want to use in world generation, as it can't serialize `null` blocks correctly!
